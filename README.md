# üçï Domino's CLI Pizza Ordering System

Command-line interface (CLI) pizza ordering system built with Rust. This project allows users to view a menu of pizzas, add them to a cart, and place an order with confirmation. It's an example of using modularized Rust code to handle user inputs, display information, and process orders.

## Features

- **Menu Display:** View a list of pizzas, categorized by veg and non-veg, with details like price, size, and whether it's vegetarian.
- **Add to Cart:** Select pizzas from the menu and specify the quantity to add to your cart.
- **User Information:** Enter customer details (name, phone number, address) for order confirmation.
- **Order Confirmation:** Review your order, and confirm it before checkout.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles incorrect input for phone numbers, quantities, and other user inputs.

## Project Structure

```bash
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cart.rs       # Cart and order-related logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs       # Entry point, handles the main loop
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pizza.rs      # Pizza struct, menu, and display functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user.rs       # User-related logic and input handling
```

## Modules

### `main.rs`

This is the entry point of the application. It coordinates the workflow:

- Starts by asking for user details.
- Allows users to choose from viewing the menu, adding items to the cart, and placing an order.
- Imports the necessary modules like `user`, `pizza`, and `cart`.

### `user.rs`

Handles the user‚Äôs personal information:

- **`User` struct:** Stores user details like name, phone, and address.
- **`get_user_details()`**: Captures user input with error handling.

### `pizza.rs`

Manages the pizza menu:

- **`Pizza` struct:** Holds details about each pizza, such as name, price, category, and size.
- **`show_pizza()`**: Returns a list of available pizzas.
- **`display_menu()`**: Prints the pizza menu to the console.

### `cart.rs`

Handles shopping cart logic:

- **`CartItem` struct:** Stores details of pizzas added to the cart, along with quantity.
- **`add_to_cart()`**: Adds a selected pizza to the cart.
- **`make_order()`**: Displays the order summary and processes the order confirmation.

## Future Improvements

- **Add More Customization:**
  - Allow users to select different pizza toppings or customize orders.
- **Improve UI:**
  - Enhance the CLI experience with a clearer layout and better user interaction.
- **Order History:**
  - Add the ability to save and view past orders.
- **Discounts and Offers:**
  - Implement promotional discounts or coupon codes.
